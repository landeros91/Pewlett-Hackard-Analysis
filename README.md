# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview and Analysis
The purpose  of the Pewlett Hackard project is to to analyze the 6 csv files containing employee information and see how many employees will be retiring. When analyzing the data, I broke it down so that Pewlett Hackard can see what departemnts will have upcoming retired employees. This will give them a heads up when it comes to new hires as well as who qualifies from the retired folks to be in the mentorship program.

### Resources
- Data Source: departments.csv, employees.csv, salaries.csv, dept_manager.csv, dept_emp.csv, titles.csv

## Results
- Majority of retiting are Senior Engineers
- 2 managers will retire. This means that there is possibility for promotion.
- Total of 90,398 employees will retire.
- 1,549 employees will qualify for mentorhsip program.

2. There is not enough retirement-ready employees to mentor the next generation. With only 1,549 the mentors would have to be broken up to their respcected fields to give the new hires well rounded mentorship. For example, you can not assign a staff member to mentor someone for a manager position witout having that experience.
