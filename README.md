# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview and Analysis
The purpose  of the Pewlett Hackard project is to to analyze the 6 csv files containing employee information and see how many employees will be retiring. When analyzing the data, I broke it down so that Pewlett Hackard can see what departemnts will have upcoming retired employees. This will give them a heads up when it comes to new hires as well as who qualifies from the retired folks to be in the mentorship program.
